              <div class="w-full flex justify-center text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-px sm:mb-4">Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart, its blood vessels, and the circulatory system. It is a broad term that encompasses various conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valvular heart disease, among others.

              <div class = "w-full flex text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-px sm:mb-4">
                <ul>
                  <li>	Chest pain or discomfort: This is one of the most well-known symptoms of heart disease. It may feel like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or aching in the chest. The pain may radiate to the arms, jaw, neck, back, or stomach.</li>
                  <li>	Shortness of breath: Feeling breathless, especially during physical activity or even at rest, can be a sign of heart disease. It may be accompanied by wheezing or a sense of being unable to catch your breath.</li>
                  <li>	Fatigue: Persistent fatigue or exhaustion that is not relieved by rest can be a symptom of heart disease. This can occur due to the heart's reduced ability to pump blood effectively. </li>
                  <li>	Palpitations: Irregular heartbeats, skipped beats, or a rapid heartbeat may be felt as palpitations. It may feel like the heart is racing or fluttering.</li>
                  <li>	Dizziness or lightheadedness: Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or fainting can be associated with heart problems. This may occur due to a drop in blood pressure or inadequate blood flow to the brain..</li>
                  <li>	Swelling: Fluid retention can cause swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, or abdomen. This is known as edema and can occur as a result of heart failure or other heart conditions.</li>
                  <li>	Slow-healing sores or frequent infections: Wounds take longer to heal, and there is a higher susceptibility to infections.</li>
                  <li>	Nausea or vomiting: Some individuals with heart disease may experience nausea, indigestion, or vomiting, particularly if the heart's pumping function is compromised.</li>
                  <li>	Pain in other parts of the body: Sometimes, heart disease can cause pain or discomfort in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper back. This is known as referred pain.</li>
                </ul>

              <div class = "w-full flex font-bold text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-0 sm:mb-4">Parameters:</div>
              <div class = "w-full flex justify-center text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-px sm:mb-4">
                <ul>
                  <li>	Age: Age is an important risk factor for heart disease. The risk of developing heart disease increases with age.</li>
                  <li>	Sex: Gender can influence the risk of heart disease. Men generally have a higher risk than premenopausal women, although the risk for women increases after menopause.</li>
                  <li>	CP (Chest Pain): This refers to the presence or absence of chest pain or discomfort, which can be indicative of heart disease. CP is often assessed using a scale or categorized into different types, such as typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic.</li>
                  <li>	Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure): This represents the resting blood pressure measurement, which is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a significant risk factor for heart disease.</li>
                  <li>	Chol (Cholesterol): Cholesterol levels, specifically the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (often referred to as "bad" cholesterol), can contribute to the development of heart disease. Elevated cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk.</li>
                  <li>	FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar): Fasting blood sugar levels are used to assess the presence of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, both of which are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.</li>
                  <li>	Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results): Resting electrocardiography (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart at rest. It can provide information about abnormalities, such as arrhythmias or ischemia, that may indicate underlying heart disease.</li>
                  <li>	Thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved): Thalach refers to the maximum heart rate achieved during exercise stress testing. It is used to assess cardiovascular fitness and can provide insights into heart health.</li>
                  <li>	Exang (Exercise-Induced Angina): This parameter indicates the presence or absence of angina (chest pain or discomfort) induced by physical exertion or exercise. It can help evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease.</li>
                  <li>	Oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest): Oldpeak measures the ST segment depression on the ECG during exercise stress testing. It is used as an indicator of myocardial ischemia or reduced blood flow to the heart.</li>
                  <li>	Slope (Slope of the ST Segment): The slope of the ST segment on the ECG during exercise stress testing provides additional information about the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.</li>
                  <li>	Ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy): This parameter represents the number of major blood vessels (coronary arteries) that are visibly narrowed or blocked based on fluoroscopy, an imaging technique.</li>
                  <li>	Thal (Thalassemia): Thalassemia is a blood disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin. In the context of heart disease, the parameter "thal" likely refers to thallium stress testing, a nuclear imaging technique used to evaluate blood flow to the heart.</li>
