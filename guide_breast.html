              <div class="w-full flex justify-center text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-px sm:mb-4">Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the breasts, usually starting in the milk ducts or the lobules, which are the glands that produce milk. It is the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide, although it can also affect men, albeit rarely.</div>

              <div class = "w-full flex text-justify text-[#8cd7f5] sm:text-lg m-px sm:mb-4">
                <ul>
                  <li>	A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area: This is one of the most common signs of breast cancer. The lump may feel hard, irregular in shape, and different from the surrounding breast tissue.</li>
                  <li>	Changes in breast size or shape: The breast may appear swollen or noticeably different from its usual size or shape. This can happen in one or both breasts.</li>
                  <li>	Nipple changes: The nipple may become inverted (pulled inward) or change its position or shape. It might also have scaling, crusting, or discharge, which can be clear, bloody, or of another color.</li>
                  <li>	Breast pain or tenderness: While breast pain is not typically a common symptom of breast cancer, some individuals with breast cancer may experience discomfort or tenderness in the breast area.</li>
                  <li>	Skin changes: The skin on the breast may become red, dimpled, puckered (resembling an orange peel texture), or develop ridges or thickened areas.</li>
                  <li>	Swelling in the breast or armpit: Some individuals with breast cancer may notice swelling or a lump in the armpit or lymph nodes near the breast. This can occur if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>	Mean Radius: It refers to the average distance from the center of a breast tumor to its outer edge. It provides an estimation of the size of the tumor.</li>
                  <li>	Mean Texture: It describes the average variation in gray-scale values of the pixels in the image of the tumor. It provides information about the homogeneity or smoothness of the cell textures.</li>
                  <li>	Mean Perimeter: It represents the average length of the outer boundary of the tumor. It is a measure of the total length of the tumor border.</li>
                  <li>	Mean Area: It corresponds to the average size of the tumor, calculated by measuring the number of pixels within the boundary of the tumor. It provides an estimation of the overall area occupied by the tumor.</li>
                  <li>	Mean Smoothness: It characterizes the variation in the local curvature of the tumor boundary. It reflects the degree of irregularity or smoothness in the tumor's shape.</li>
